## 👩‍💻 Project Description

A small roguelike game made in `Svelte`.
In this project I tried to better my understanding of the `<canvas>` element and what it could do.
I also challenged myself to learn some pixel art basics and made all the sprites on my own.

## 🎉 Features

- Move player with `wasd` keys and attack enemies.
- Use spells with number keys.
- A variety of enemies to battle with.
- Keep highscores.
- Animations and sounds for better gameplay.
